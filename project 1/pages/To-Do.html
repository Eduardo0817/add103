      <p>Things i would like to try</p>
      <p>
        There are a lot of things i want to try out. Whenever i wander around on
        the internet or out in public i always see something or find something
        interesting. I see people perform, create, play, etc and it really makes
        me want to try to do somthing similar.One thing i really want to do is
        learn how to play another instrument. It seems fun but i cant decide
        with what instrument other than the piano. I would also like to do a
        puzzle with a lot of pieces. It sounds like a horrible idea but thats
        what makes me want to do it even more. The things i would like to do are
        usually the things that challenge me in a fun way like puzzles. I have
        been doing 3d crystal puzzles which are fun but they can be very
        challenging even with the instructions. crochet seems like another fun
        thing to do. I would like to start something like this in the winter
        because it just seems like a relaxing idea that i can do on my free time
