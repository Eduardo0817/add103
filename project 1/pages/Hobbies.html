          When i was little, i always wanted to play an instrument. My friend
          joined the school band and then i decided to join them. My first
          instrument was the trombone. I played it for about 3 years and then i
          quit but i still really liked it. When i quit the school band i
          decided that i wanted to play a different something different. I
          decided to try and learn the piano when i was 11-12. I started by
          pllaying songs from games i played and thats where i sorta just how i
          started.

        <dd>
          I started taking photos when i was around 12-14 whenever we went out
          on a vacation. I almost never took photos because i didn't know what
          or how to photograph. I always started with something small like a
          flower, decor, or a picture on the wall. I started to photograph
          familiy photos whenever i got the chance. All of those where on my
          phone and i never went beyond that until i started to go to Mcc. I was
          given an actual camera to take photos. I did the same thing as i did
          last time and took photos of smaller objects or things to really
          understand the settings.
