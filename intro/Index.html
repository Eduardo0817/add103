    <h1>Eduardo's Intro</h1>
    <p>Im taking this class because i am persuing a future in graphic design. This sprt of thing isnt my strong suit scine it confuses me a lot but i have to put in the effort. Another reason is that i wanted to learn something in my first year here in MCC</p>

    <p>I first started to play the piano when i was 11. I always loved the sound that it makes, it brought me so much joy when i hear a song in piano. I may have played the pianoo for a long time but i stiil cant play with both hands on different rythyms. I hope that one day i can learn how to play the piano with two hands and play something for a minute.</p>
<h3>Photos of flowers</h3>

<p>When i was about 13-15 i saw a flower nd thought that it was really pretty. Then i had an idea, to take a photo and admire it when ever i think about the flower. Then after that i started to actually notice plants and flowers all around me and thhe places i would go. I would take countless photos of plants in different angles and lighting on my phone, since i dont have a camera, and it brought me a lot of happiness.</p>
