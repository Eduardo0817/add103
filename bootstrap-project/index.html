        <h2 class="display-2">Trip to NewYork</h2>
        <p>
          About a Year ago, me and my family went to Newyork. We left on a
          Thursday and came back on a Monday morning. We went to go see Niagra
          falls and then we went to see the statue of Liberty. The whole trip
          was fun and dreadful. It felt like an eternity when we were on our way
          to Newyork and when we were coming back. During our first stop at
          Niagra falls, me and my family went on a boat that takes you close to
          the waterfalls and gets you all wet. It was very windy, fun, and
          beautiful. We only stayed there for about a day and a half. While I
          was there to see the statue, I went to time square, and I also saw the
          empire building. The whole place was crowded with people and cars, not
          as loud as I thought it would be. It was very nice in the city and
          some buildings were way bigger than I thought. I also went to a
          Nintendo store there. Once me and my brothers heard that there was one
          in the city, we immediately went straight for it. Once I got there, I
          ended up buying a Sprigatitio keychain and a animal crossing cat
          plushie. The whole trip was fun but slow and unexpected, I almost
          didn't go. I also didn't tell my friends I went on this trip and when
          I missed school, they all assumed I was sick, and they were shocked to
          hear that I randomly just went to Newyork during the week. Teehee
