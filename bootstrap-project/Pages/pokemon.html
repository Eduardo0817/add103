        <p>
          When I was a kid, I was obsessed with Pokémon. I watched the show, and
          I collected cards, toys, and the games but the thing that brought me
          the most joy was the pluses. My first plushie was a Chespin plush and
          I loved it so much. I slept with it and took it everywhere I went.
          Soon after I started to get more and more. At first my parents thought
          it would only be a small collection, but it turned into a big one. I
          didn't stop buying them until I was 16 years old. They often scolded
          me for it, but I didn't care because it brought me so much joy. I have
          almost all the starters and the Eevee evolutions. I played many games,
          but I have to say that my favorite one was probably my first game on
          my 3ds, Pokémon sapphire. It was when I was new to playing the actual
          game. I played some of the ones that came after that like Pokémon X,
          Pokémon Ultra moon, Pokémon Sword. The one on the switch was good in
          my opinion. The newer ones changed the style of the game and just
          doesn't feel the same, so I haven't gotten any of them, so I never
          investigated them, and I don't know if I'll ever get them. My brother
          and cousins also liked Pokémon, but I highly doubt that they liked it
          like I did. My obsession died down but I still really love the game
          and its franchise since it gave me a wonderful Childhood
