        <p>
          In Mcc one of my classes is Digital Photography. In this class I
          learned how to use an actual camera. I learned what Iso is and how it
          affects the lighting. I learned shutter speed settings and F stop
          settings. I had many Projects in this class, and I think that the
          recent one must be my favorite one. In this project I had to set
          things up and fabricate a scene. So, I photographed my cousin getting
          her make up done. This project was all last minute and thought it was
          stressful; I had fun in the end. When it came down to my work,
          everyone seemed to like my photo. I showed my cousin the photos, and I
          gave her the mini prints so she can keep them as a token of
          appreciation. I am very thankful to my cousin since without her, this
          project wouldnâ€™t have worked out. Whether it was them being nice or if
          they genially liked it, I felt like I did a very good job. I printed
          one of the photos in a big print and it would be hung up near my
          class, since someone wanted to hang them up. I liked how they turned
          out and i hope the ones in the future will turn out better or just as
          good as these did. My dad bought me my very own camera recently and I
          have been photographing my family and my house with that camera. Soon
          I'll must photograph my brother's baptism, and I am very excited and
          very scared.
