        <p>
          In 2020, Me and my brother went to my grandpas shop to work. During
          our time there, my little brother got a cat in the shop, we named him
          Toby. That cat was very weird and confusing. He liked to sit down in
          the middle of the office and do nothing. We would place a bottle cap
          on his head, and he wouldn't care. He was normally an outside cat, but
          he seemed to like it indoors a lot. He would come up to us to pet him
          and sometimes he would lay on our lap. One time my dad scared him, and
          he started to run, and he bumped his head on the glass door and when
          everyone laughed, he started to freak out and he kept running all over
          the place. The more we went the more he grew attached to us. We would
          find him waiting outside the office doors so we could let him in.
          There was more than just toby. The other cats were more scared of
          people than toby was, and they often run if they see someone. The cats
          were named after their distinctive features. One of them was named
          Hazel because of her eyes, another was named spot because of the spot
          on her nose. One of the cats, she didn't have a name, gave birth to
          five kittens. She had two black, 2 oranges and 1 mixed. The mom and
          all the other cats, except spot, were tabby cats and we were all
          shocked to see that the kids don't look anything like the mom. But
          then again genetics are a thing. We all assumed that Toby was the
          father since he was the only male we were aware of, that was until i
          went around the shop and noticed a Calico, a black cat, and a orange
          tabby inside an abandoned trailer.
