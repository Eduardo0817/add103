        <p>
          In 8th grade I had a Binder that I drew on and wrote on in metalic
          markers. My Friend did some doodling in the back of it too and we both
          had fun with it. One day, I was cleaning my room and then I saw the
          binder. It brought me so many memories and I couldn't bring myself to
          throw it away, so I kept it. I sent a picture to my friend and we both
          went down memory lane and had a nice time. Currently, it's on my shelf
          and is surrounded by other objects that have a sentimental value. I
          have a photo of a random person, gift cards, hospital visitor sticker,
          hospital wristband, water bottle, ceramic bowl, a pencil someone gave
          me, etc. Not only do I have that whole shelf, but I do have a small
          “mural” on the top. I have plushies that I like either Holding photos
          of me when I was young, my diploma. I also just use it to put all my
          big stuffed animals, and I always liked it. They also have some
          sentimental value, so it fits well with the shelf. Nobody in my house
          has this in their room and they thought I was weird in the beginning.
          They all told me that it was a waste of space and that it was trash,
          but they didn't see what I saw in the objects. They brought me so much
          joy and it's mainly meant for me not for them, so I understand why
          they don't understand the reason behind it.
