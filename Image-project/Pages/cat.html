          Main
          <p>
            In 2020, Me and my brother went to my grandpas shop to work. During
            our time there, my little brother got a cat in the shop, we named
            him Toby. That cat was very weird and confusing. He liked to sit
            down in the middle of the office and do nothing. We would place a
            bottle cap on his head, and he wouldn't care. He was normally an
            outside cat, but he seemed to like it indoors a lot. He would come
            up to us to pet him and sometimes he would lay on our lap. One time
            my dad scared him, and he started to run, and he bumped his head on
            the glass door and when everyone laughed, he started to freak out
            and he kept running all over the place. The more we went the more he
            grew attached to us. We would find him waiting outside the office
            doors so we could let him in. There was more than just toby. The
            other cats were more scared of people than toby was, and they often
            run if they see someone. The cats were named after their distinctive
            features. One of them was named Hazel because of her eyes, another
            was named spot because of the spot on her nose. One of the cats, she
            didn't have a name, gave birth to five kittens. She had two black, 2
            oranges and 1 mixed. The mom and all the other cats, except spot,
            were tabby cats and we were all shocked to see that the kids don't
            look anything like the mom. But then again genetics are a thing. We
            all assumed that Toby was the father since he was the only male we
            were aware of, that was until i went around the shop and noticed a
            Calico, a black cat, and a orange tabby inside an abandoned trailer.
